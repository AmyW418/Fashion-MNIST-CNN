# Fashion-MNIST-CNN

Created CNN models for classifying Fashion MNIST, reaching 93% test accuracy.

Started with a basic CNN model, using only Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers. This model had a testing accuracy of 92% but the model was severly overfitted shown in the loss plot. Then added Dropout layers to correct the overfitting for model two. The loss then dropped by about 0.2 and accuracy increased by about 1%. In both models, I got better results for the test data than the validation data. 

Numerous values and layer combinations tried during testing, more of the process written in the comments of the file.
