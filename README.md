# Fashion-MNIST-CNN

Created CNN models for classifying Fashion MNIST, reaching 92.7% test accuracy.

Started with a basic CNN model, using only Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers. This model had a testing accuracy of 91.7% but the model was severly overfitted shown in the loss plot. Then added Dropout layers to correct the overfitting for model two. The loss then dropped by about 0.2 and accuracy increased by about 1%.

Numerous values and layer combinations tried during testing, more of the process written in the comments of the file.
